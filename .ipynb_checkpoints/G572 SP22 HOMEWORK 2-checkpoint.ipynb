    "<b>Background Info: </b>In this problem set, you are going to be working with data related the deep sandstone aquifer of northeastern Illinois. This aquifer has been in the local news around Joliet and Aurora recently because of large and continuing declines in heads due to 150+ years of unsustainable withdrawals. [Click here](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/99644/gwavailneildeepaquiferfactsheet2_2015-02.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y) to read a short paper discussing the issue, and [click here](https://www.theherald-news.com/2017/03/28/joliet-explores-options-on-future-water-supplies/ax3gcyb/) to read a recent local news article. Many communities and industries in this region, particularly Will, Kendall, Kane, and McHenry Counties, rely on deep sandstone wells as their source of water. Withdrawals from the sandstone increased fairly steadily from the mid-1800s to 1980, when some communities in Cook, DuPage, and Lake Counties started to switch to Lake Michigan water. From 1980 to 2000, demands decreased due to these switches. Since then withdrawals have been increasing at a slower rate."

Joliet is in Will County, where sandstone usage persists. In fact, `Joliet #10` is located at the center of the cone of depression."
